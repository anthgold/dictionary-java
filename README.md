# Project: Dictionary

#### _Creates a program that lets users create a dictionary, version 1.0, current as of 4.29.2016._

#### By _**Anthony C. Gold**_

## Description

This is the solo coding exercise from the Epicodus Java course, week 2. It creates a program that lets users create a dictionary. It makes two classes: one for Word, and one for Definition. The homepage of the app should list out all of the words, and let you click on them to view all of their definitions. A user should be able to add a word, and when viewing a word, be able to add one or more definitions.


Objectives:

* An instance of one class appears in the method of another class
* Spark routes process GET and POST requests/responses successfully
* Objects are created from a custom class with a custom constructor
* Object unit tests are organized into their own files separate from integration tests
* All previous code review standards have been met
* You are able to discuss the flow of your code and concepts behind it with an instructor using the correct terminology.

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_

## Known Bugs

_{Are there issues that have not yet been resolved that you want to let users know you know?  Outline any issues that would impact use of your application.  Share any workarounds that are in place. }_
